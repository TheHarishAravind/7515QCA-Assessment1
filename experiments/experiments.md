## Instructions ##

*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### Experiment name ###

(Using a Light Sensor & Analog Inputs)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt about the manipulating a phototransistor and learnt more about the threshold at which it triggers a change in the circuit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a light sensitive switch which turns on when it is dark.

### Experiment name ###

(Dimming an LED using a Potentiometer)

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt about the maximum and minimum sensitivity of a potentiometer

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a mood lights

### Experiment name ###

(Using the accelerometer to control motor speed)

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was Microbit's accelerometer feature and its capabilities

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application like a toy where Microbit is a remote control

### Experiment name ###

(Setting the tone with a Piezo Buzzer)

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something I learnt was the limitation of the Piezo Buzzer.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
