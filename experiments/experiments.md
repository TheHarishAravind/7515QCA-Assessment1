## Instructions ##

*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### Experiment name ###

Using a Light Sensor & Analog Inputs

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt about manipulating a phototransistor and learnt more about the threshold at which it triggers a change in the circuit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a light sensitive switch which turns on when it is dark.

### Experiment name ###

Dimming an LED using a Potentiometer

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt about the maximum and minimum sensitivity of a potentiometer. It was also surprising to know that potentiometer come in all sizes. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a mood lights and variable frequency lights.

### Experiment name ###

Using the accelerometer to control motor speed

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something I learnt was Microbit's accelerometer feature and its capabilities. I'd love to try more with this as this could be an amazing starting point for Motion Based activities

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application like a toy where Microbit is a remote control or a controller for a videogame console. 

### Experiment name ###

Setting the tone with a Piezo Buzzer

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something I learnt was the limitation of the Piezo Buzzer and how simple it is to play audio media using a microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a audio synthesizer or a remixer.

### Experiment name ###

Wind Power

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was how microbit can show (sort of) show live readings from an analog device. This also opened to me the ways I can utilize the led display of microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as monitoring bicycle speeds, homemade windmill etc.
